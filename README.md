### 
Hello and welcome. \\
This is a repository with the completed* project for the Data Science applied capstone \\
course, imparted by IBM through "Coursera" platform. This is the 10th and last course for 
the Data Science Professional Certificate career path.

In this project, we used the SpaceX Rocket Launch data REST API to get some data about the 
launches performed by the company and the final outcome wether they landed succesfully or not. We 
used this data to perform some exploratory analyzis and visualizations, in order to train a 
predictive classification model with machine learning techniques that would predict the outcome 
of a new launch based in a series of attributes. 

As the project is meant to follow a satandarized sequence of steps to allow for evaluation, 
the different activities proposed are divided into 7 Jupyter Notebooks, a python code for a dashboard, 
and a powerpoint presentation. These are meant to be read in the following order (the presentation 
summarize the project so naturally, it is meant to be read in absence or supported by the other 
files):
